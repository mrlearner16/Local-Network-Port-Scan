# Local-Network-Port-Scan
"Nmap scan of local network for Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship Task 1."
# CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP

 Task Overview
Performed a TCP SYN scan (`nmap -sS`) on a local host (`192.168.1.3`) to identify open ports and assess potential security exposures.
nmap -sS 192.168.1.3
